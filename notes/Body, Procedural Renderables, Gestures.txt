 
Notes:
-make each bone have a shader, so i.e. a man can have a robot arm easily
	-Allow for simple props such as chairs or benches, otherwise just make these Voxel objects

Families of objects (that need some way of being rendered) (in order of importance):
Humanoid
Ground (a bitmap of the ground)
Chair
Car
Gun
Bullet

-have morphs with different ranges such as only raised eyebrow gesture (which actually moves both eyebrows and eyelids and lowers jaw)
-have different walk cycles for different emotions and ages.
-weight shifts for different emotions while talking (have a list of emotion changes in text, i.e. ":inquisitive: What did you say?"
-Program hysteresis into appropriate variables to create smarter virtual machanics in creatures (a sort of short-term sensory memory) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hysteresis

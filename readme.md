# RetroEngine-cs
This is a mostly useless C# game engine based upon the hubris of not having dependencies. Its successor is bonefinity (C++), which gradually shrinks as it utilizes dependencies better. This has been declared silly since it reimplements many things that are available in the .NET framework and in game frameworks.
